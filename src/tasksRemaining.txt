Tasks remaining:
1. When Next button is pressed, make sure it checks whether every input is filled or not.
2. When Submit button is pressed, it will change its path and show the overall result on the screen.
3. Once Submit has been pressed and the info shown on screen, there will be 3 buttons: (A) Edit, (B) Delete, (C) Add More in DisplayMedicalCard.tsx
4. Add More button will redirect us to a form specially made for creators.
5. Will have to look to store the values of Yes/No questions on the form.
6. Using Zod as a checker for the input fields.
7. Use created as a prop in both DisplayMedicalCard.tsx & CreateCard.tsx as: (A)created=false, then CreateCard.tsx and (B)created=true, then DisplayMedicalCard.tsx.
8. Similar process in Medical card too.
